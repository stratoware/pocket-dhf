## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it before contributing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- Git
- A GitHub account

### Finding Issues to Work On

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/stratoware/pocket-dhf/issues) page
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` for newcomers
- Issues labeled `help wanted` are great opportunities to contribute
- Feel free to ask questions on any issue

## Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pocket-dhf.git
cd pocket-dhf
```

### 2. Set Up Upstream Remote

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/stratoware/pocket-dhf.git
git fetch upstream
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Using Make (recommended)
make install

# Or using Poetry directly
poetry install
```

### 4. Install Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
make pre-commit-install
# or
poetry run pre-commit install
```

This will automatically run code quality checks before each commit.

### 5. Verify Setup

```bash
# Run tests to ensure everything works
make test

# Start the application
poetry run python main.py
```

## Making Changes

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

#### Branch Naming Conventions

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Test additions or updates

Examples:
- `feature/add-pdf-export`
- `fix/traceability-matrix-display`
- `docs/update-api-guide`

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the [Code Style](#code-style) guidelines
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: brief description

More detailed explanation of what changed and why.
Reference any related issues: #123"
```

#### Commit Message Guidelines

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- First line should be 50 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant
- Separate subject from body with a blank line

Good examples:
```
Add PDF export functionality for reports

Implements PDF generation using ReportLab library.
Users can now export reports directly to PDF format.

Fixes #45
```

```
Fix traceability matrix link navigation

Links in the traceability matrix were not properly
handling multi-level requirements. Updated the
navigation logic to support hierarchical IDs.

Closes #78
```

## Code Style

Pocket DHF follows strict code quality standards:

### Python Style

- **Black**: Code formatting (line length: 88)
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **flake8**: Linting
- **Type hints**: Encouraged but not required

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code
make format

# Check linting
make lint

# Check copyright headers
make copyright-check

# Check docstrings
make docstring-check

# All checks (automatically run by pre-commit)
make format && make lint
```

### Documentation Standards

- All public classes should have docstrings
- Functions with non-obvious behavior should have docstrings
- Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def calculate_rbm_score(severity: int, po: int, ph: int) -> int:
    """Calculate Risk-Benefit Matrix score.
    
    Args:
        severity: Severity level (1-9)
        po: Probability of occurrence (1-3)
        ph: Probability of harm (1-3)
        
    Returns:
        RBM score (severity √ó po √ó ph)
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If any parameter is out of range
    """
    return severity * po * ph
```

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Tests are located in the `tests/` directory
- Unit tests go in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests go in `tests/integration/`
- Test files should start with `test_`
- Test functions should start with `test_`

Example test:

```python
def test_calculate_rbm_score():
    """Test RBM score calculation."""
    manager = DHFDataManager("test_data.yaml")
    score = manager.calculate_rbm_score(4, 2, 3)
    assert score == 24
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_data_utils.py

# Run with verbose output
poetry run pytest -v

# Run with coverage report
poetry run pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

### Coverage Requirements

- All new code must maintain >80% test coverage
- Pull requests that decrease coverage will not be merged
- View coverage report: `open htmlcov/index.html`

```bash
# Run with debug output
FLASK_DEBUG=1 poetry run python main.py

# Run specific test with print output
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_data_utils.py -v -s

# Start Python debugger
poetry run python -m pdb main.py
```
