## Executive Summary

This Risk Management Report provides a comprehensive analysis of all identified risks associated with the {{device_type}} device. The report follows ISO 14971:2019 guidelines for risk management of medical devices and includes detailed risk assessments, mitigation strategies, and residual risk evaluations.

The risk management process has identified **{{total_risks}}** risks across **{{risk_categories}}** categories, with appropriate mitigation measures implemented to reduce risk to acceptable levels. All risks have been evaluated using a systematic approach considering probability of occurrence, probability of harm, and severity of harm.

## Risk Management Process Overview

### Risk Management Team
- **Risk Manager:** [Name]
- **Clinical Expert:** [Name]  
- **Engineering Lead:** [Name]
- **Quality Assurance:** [Name]

### Risk Management Methodology
This risk management process follows ISO 14971:2019 and includes:
1. Risk identification and analysis
2. Risk evaluation and acceptability determination
3. Risk control measures implementation
4. Residual risk evaluation
5. Risk management review and monitoring

### Risk Acceptability Criteria
Risks are evaluated using a Risk-Benefit-Management (RBM) scoring system:
- **RBM Score â‰¤ 2:** Acceptable risk
- **RBM Score 3-6:** Acceptable with justification
- **RBM Score > 6:** Unacceptable risk requiring additional controls
